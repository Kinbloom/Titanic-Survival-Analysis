# Week-9-Independent-Project

During this weekâ€™s Independent project, you will get the test your understanding of the following methodologies to solving business problems.
Apply supervised learning algorithms such as:
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Naive Bayes

**Experimental Procedure**

Download the two datasets from the given links:

Dataset 1 Source: 
Train Dataset Source: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/download/train.csv (Links to an external site.)
Test Dataset Source: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/download/test.csv (Links to an external site.)

Dataset 2 Source: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spambase (Links to an external site.)]

**Instructions**

1. Randomly partition each dataset into two parts i.e 80 - 20  sets.
2. For dataset 1, because we don't have the label for the test set, we will use the train set to create train and test data (i.e. splitting further), then perform K-nearest neighbor classification.
3. For dataset 2, perform classification of the testing set samples using the Naive Bayes Classifier.
4. Compute the accuracy (percentage of correct classification).
5. Report the confusion matrix of each classifier.
6. Repeat step 2 to step 4 twice, each time splitting the datasets differently i.e. 70-30, 60-40, then note the outcomes of your modeling.
7. Suggest and apply at least one of the optimization techniques that you learned earlier this week.
8. Provide further recommendations to improve both classifiers.
